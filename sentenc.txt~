ecently, 
it 
was 
found 
that 
rhythmic 
move- 
ments 
(e.g. 
locomotion, 
swimmeret 
beating) 
are 
con- 
trolled 
by 
mutually 
coupled 
endogeneous 
neural 
oscil- 
lators 
(Kennedy 
and 
Davis, 
1977; 
Pearson 
and 
Iles, 
1973; 
Stein, 
1974; 
Shik 
and 
Orlovsky, 
1976; 
Grillner 
and 
Zangger, 
1979). 
Meanwhile, 
it 
has 
been 
found 
out 
that 
the 
phase 
resetting 
experiment 
is 
useful 
to 
in- 
vestigate 
the 
interaction 
of 
neural 
oscillators 
(Perkel 
et 
al., 
1963; 
Stein, 
1974). 
In 
the 
preceding 
paper 
(Yamanishi 
et 
al., 
1979), 
we 
studied 
the 
functional 
interaction 
between 
the 
neural 
oscillator 
which 
is 
assumed 
to 
control 
finger 
tapping 
and 
the 
neural 
networks 
which 
control 
some 
tasks. 
The 
tasks 
were 
imposed 
on 
the 
subject 
as 
the 
perturbation 
of 
the 
phase 
resetting 
experiment. 
In 
this 
paper, 
we 
in- 
vestigate 
the 
control 
mechanism 
of 
the 
coordinated 
finger 
tapping 
by 
both 
hands. 
First, 
the 
subjects 
were 
instructed 
to 
coordinate 
the 
finger 
tapping 
by 
both 
hands 
so 
as 
to 
keep 
the 
phase 
difference 
between 
two 
hands 
constant. 
The 
performance 
was 
evaluated 
by 
a 
systematic 
error 
and 
a 
standard 
deviation 
of 
phase 
differences. 
Second, 
we 
propose 
two 
coupled 
neural 
oscillators 
as 
a 
model 
for 
the 
coordinated 
finger 
tapping. 
Dynamical 
behavior 
of 
the 
model 
system 
is 
analyzed 
by 
using 
phase 
transition 
curves 
which 
were 
measured 
on 
one 
hand 
finger 
tapping 
in 
the 
previous 
experiment 
(Yamanishi 
et 
al., 
1979). 
Prediction 
by 
the 
model 
is 
in 
good 
agreement 
with 
the 
results 
of 
the 
experiments. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
suggested 
that 
the 
neural 
mechanism 
which 
controls 
the 
coordinated 
finger 
tap- 
ping 
may 
be 
composed 
of 
a 
coupled 
system 
of 
two 
neural 
oscillators 
each 
of 
which 
controls 
the 
right 
and 
the 
left 
finger 
tapping 
respectively.
