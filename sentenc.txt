Figure 2 shows systematic errors and their standard
deviations during selfpaced finger tapping. The system-
atic error is an average of the difference between
measured delay and standard delay. The abscissa is the
standard phase difference, where phase difference 0.0 is
same as phase difference 1.0. As shown in Fig. 2, when
the phase difference is 0.0 and 0.5, the standard
deviation is smaller in both groups of subjects in
comparison to that of other phases. So, the perfor
mance of both hands finger tapping is better at the
phase difference 0.0 and 0.5 than that at other phase
differences. Hereafter, we call the finger tapping by
both hands with phase difference 0.0 the synchronous
rhythm pattern and with phase difference 0.5 the
alternate rhythm pattern. The skilled subjects showed
smaller standard deviations than the unskilled ones as
we had expected. Good performance for the synchro-
nous and the alternate rhythm patterns is noted also
from the graph of systematic errors. Let us explain this
characteristics on the graph of the unskilled subjects.
For example, when the subject tries to tap by both
hands with the standard phase difference 0.1, that is,
the delay of 100 ms, as the systematic error is - 30 ms,
the phase difference decreases to 70 ms and the tapping
pattern shows a tendency to resemble the synchronous
rhythm pattern. Moreover, when the finger tapping by
both hands with the phase difference 0.9 is performed,
as the systematic error is 40ms, an average of delay
elongates to 940 ms. This tapping pattern also shows a
tendency to resemble the synchronous rhythm pattern.
On the whole, when the subject tries to tap with the
standard phase differences which are close to 0.0 or 1.0
(i.e., 0.1, 0.8, and 0.9), the phase difference shows a
tendency to approach to 0.0. Hence the tapping pat-
tern inclines to the synchronous rhythm pattern.
